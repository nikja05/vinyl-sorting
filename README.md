# Vinyl Sorting

## Background
I wanted to have a file where I could see my vinyl collection.
That's it.

## Overview
The script takes user input, in the form
    [artist name], [album name].
It then sorts by artist name and writes the results to a .txt file called vinyls.txt.
To exit the script, one only has to type "X".

### To be added:
- Change order of sorting (e.g. by album)
- Make it possible to delete the whole list
- Make it possible to print list to UI.
