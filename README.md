# Vinyl Sorting V1.1C

## Background
I wanted to have a file where I could see my vinyl collection. \n
That's it.

## Overview

### How it works
The script takes user input, in the form \n
    [artist name], [album name]. \n
It then sorts by artist name and writes the results to a .txt file called vinyls.txt. \n
To exit the script, one only has to type "X".

### Further options

#### Delete whole list
Typing "vm del all" will delete the whole list. \n
It is not possible to delete a single item.

#### Change order of sorting

#### Print list to terminal
